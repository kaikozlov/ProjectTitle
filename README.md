## A new view for KOReader
Project: Title is a plugin made by two people who love KOreader but wanted to expand upon the Cover Browser plugin. We desired an interface that would blend in with the very best that commercial eReaders have. Something that would make the time between books, looking for that next read, as pleasant as possible.


## Features
* **A Speedy Title Bar**: Thinner with more functionality, adding Favorites, History, Open Last Book, and Up Folder buttons to help you get exactly where you need as fast as possible.

* **A Fresh Book Listing**: New fonts, new text, new icons for books without covers and unsupported files. An optional variable-length progress bar that shows the relative size of each book. Book listings adapt to the screen size and number of items on screen.

* **A Fitting Folder**: Folders no longer show slashes in their names, and instead are shown your choice of cover image, thumbnails, or a generic icon. The arrow to move up a folder has been moved up into the title bar, to give more space for your books.

* **An Informative Footer**: Shows the page controls and your choice of either the current folder or a device status bar showing time, wifi, battery, and frontlight states. The location of the page controls can be set to either the lower right or the lower left.

* **A Matching Book Status Page**: The default book status page (available as a screensaver) have been updated to show the book's description and your current progress, as well as having its design updated to match the new book listings. A setting is available to restore the original one, if desired. 

* **A Few Nice Extras**: Autoscan for new books on USB eject, make list and grid items larger or smaller with gestures (pinch/spread), a trophy icon to mark finished books, displaying the tags/keywords for books in list mode, and custom sort methods (author last name, book size/page count).

* **Additional Customization**: For advanced use cases, KOReader's "user patches" system allows modifying the plugin further. Community patches are available, or you can write your own with a little Lua.


## Supported devices
* Kobo — designed and tested on Aura One and Sage.
* Jailbroken Kindle — supported since version 2025.04v1.
* Android — supported since version 2025.04v2.
* PocketBook, Boox, Bigme and others should work as well.

## Things to know
* The plugin works best with EPUBs and PDFs that have metadata (title, author, series) and cover images. We recommend using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to manage this.
* A "filenames only" display mode is included if you prefer a plain list but still want the other features.
* Display modes with many visual elements (like a 4x4 grid with folder thumbnails on older devices) may be slower than a plain list. Performance varies by device and settings.

## Who this (probably) is not for:
* KOReader users who prefer a barebones UI. If you are happy picking your next read from a list of filenames then KOReader already does this extremely well!
* KOReader users who want a phone-style home screen or endless customization via onscreen menus. You should check out SimpleUI, ZenUI, Bookshelf and other KOReader UI plugins instead.
* KOReader users who prize speed above all else. Pretty has a price and while it depends on your device and features you pick, Project: Title may be slower than sticking to a plain list or Cover Browser. A 4x4 grid with folder thumbnails enabled on an older Kindle will definitely see some longer page turns, but you'll just have to try it to see if it bothers you.


## Install
[Step-by-Step Install Guide](../../wiki/Installation)


## Customize
We made this plugin to be what we want it to be so we can't implement everyone's feature requests or suggestions. However, we have tried to make it very easy to modify through what KOReader calls "user patches". There are already many available and if you want to learn a little Lua you can even make your own.

## Uninstall 
* To disable: Open the plugins menu, uncheck Project:Title and restart your device.
* To completely remove: Open the plugins menu, long-press Project: Title, choose the option to delete the plugin (and settings) and restart your device.
